				<code>First Principles</code>
			</header>
			
			<p>There are a number of basic principles and terms that are common to all types of sailing - whether your boat is a small dhingy, an ocean-going yatch, or anything in between. If you are new to the sport, you should acquaint yourself with these principles so that you have a thorough understanding of the fundamentals of good sailing before you go afloat for the first time. 
			</p>
			<h5>Safety Afloat</h5>
			<p>Water is a potentially hostile environment so safety is an important consideration whenever you go afloat. Sailing is not a particularly dangerous sport as long as a few sensible guidelines are followed, including wearing suitable clothing and using appropriate buoyancy gear. You should aim to develop a healthy respect for the water and only sail within the limits of your experience. This will minimize any risks and help to ensure that your sailing is not marred by accidents.

				<code>Boat Parts</code>
			</header>
			
			<p>Knowing and understanding the names used for the different parts of a boat are important first steps in learning to sail. These names, along with the terms used to describe the various maneuvers, are part of the language of sailing, which has developed over centuries to define all aspects of seamanship. All sailing boats have a number of parts in common, and, while it is not necessary to memorize the contents of the nautical dictionary, it will help if you are familiar with the basic terms. 
			</p>
			
			<p>The main terms to acquaint yourself with include:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>The hull and foils</li>
				<li>The rudder</li>
				<li>The rig and fittings</li>
			</ul>
			
		</section>

				<code>Essential Equipment</code>
			</header>
			
			<p>As well as any removable rigging, there are several other items that should be aboard when you go afloat, especially if you are sailing without a safety boat present. In particular, there has to be some means of propelling the boat if you cannot sail. There must also be adequate buoyancy to keep the boat afloat in the event of a capsize, as well as bailing gear. An anchor and warp (anchor line) are also important if you sail on the sea. All equipment must be stowed safely so that it stays in place if the boat heels or capsizes. 
			</p>
			
			<p>Below is a list of essential equipment needed when sailing:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Paddles or oars</li>
				<li>Buoyancy</li>
				<li>Bailers</li>
				<li>Anchor and warp</li>
			</ul>
			
		</section>

		<section id="Main_Controls" class="main-section" >
			<header>
				<code>Main Controls</code>
			</header>
			
			<p>Rudder, centerboard, sails, and crew weight are the main controls in a sailing dinghy. They need constant adjustment to keep the boat sailing efficiently, to steer, and to alter course. Knowing how to combine these controls to manage the movement of the boat is a very important aspect of learning how to sail. When sailing with a crew, the helmsman is usually responsible for the mainsail and the rudder (via the tiller and tiller extension), while the crew takes care of the centerboard and the jib.   
			</p>
			
			<p>Below are a list of things you need to do and be aware of to maintain the main controls:</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Using the rudder</li>
				<li>Turning effect of the rudder</li>
				<li>Using the sails</li>
				<li>Turning effect of the sails</li>
				<li>Using the crew's weight</li>
				<li>Turning using the crew's weight</li>
				<li>Using the centerboard</li>
			</ul>
			
		</section>

		<section id="Points_of_Sailing" class="main-section">
			<header>
				<code>Points of Sailing</code>
			</header>
			
			<p>The direction in which a boat is being sailed is often described in relation to its angle to the wind. Collectively, these angles are known as the "points of sailing". When you change from one point of sailing to another, the sails, the centerboard, and the position of the crew all need to be adjusted to suit the new angle of the boat in relation to the wind.</p>
			
			<p>The points of sailing include (points are listed in clockwise order):</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>No-Sail Zone</li>
				<li>Close-Reach</li>
				<li>Beam Reach</li>
				<li>Broad Reach</li>
				<li>Training Run</li>
				<li>Run</li>
				<li>Beam Reach</li>
				<li>Close Reach</li>
				<li>Close-Hauled</li>
			</ul>
